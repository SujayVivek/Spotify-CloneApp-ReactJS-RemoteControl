							SPOTIFY CLONE
-Made Login.js file
	-use rfce an EF7 command
	-Add <Login/> to App.js
	-Create Login.css
	-import './Login.css' into Login.js
	-do <img src="https://getheavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spotify2019-830x350.jpg" alt=""/>
	to get the spotify logo
	-add a <a> tag saying "LOGIN WITH SPOTIFY"

	-apply some css to the logo and the <a> tag
		.login{
		    display:grid;
		    place-items:center;
		    height:100vh;
		    background-color: black;
		}
		.login img{
 			   width:100%;
		}
		.login a{
    			padding:20px;
    			background-color: #1db854;
    			border-radius: 99px;
    			font-weight: 800;
    			color:white;
    			text-decoration:none;
		}

	-Create a spotify.js file- (we wont use this as a component, but we will use this for redirecting stuffs)
	-ADDING ENDPOINT TO THE <a> TAG
	// https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/# -this is for the documentation

	export const authEndpoint = "https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize";
    	//this Endpoint will direct us to Spotify Login Page on clicking the Login Button

	const redirectUri= "http://localhost:3000";
    	//after logining in, it redirects us to our localhost
	
	-just add the client ID variable
	const clientId="8b626eda5bc94b3#b5a3826f3f05cd85";//make your own client id - Ive altered it

	-MAKE SCOPES
	//scopes are written so that the user is not allowed to delete any stuff from out websites

	-create the Login URL-inside of spotify.js
	
	-after creating the LoginURL- put this url onto the <a href={LoginURL}>LOGIN WITH SPOTIFY</a> on the Login.js
	-here we cant just directly write LoginURL- we need to import it into the Login.js File- by 
						import {LoginURL} from "./spotify"

	-Now we want to get that Token from the URL
		we do that inside of spotify.js
		just byhart that code lmao!

	-Now that we got the token inside out export const variable called getTokenFromUrl
		we go back to App.js to use it
	-now how do we load it whenever we get the login page filled and redirected back
		-we want to run a piece of code, when a component loads ! How do we do that?!
		-we make use of UseEffect Hook;.
	-now we go to the App.js file and try to get that token using the UseEffect Hook

	-once the code in UseEffect is completely written. Now we have the token inside of a variable named token
	-This..now to interact with all the Spotify songs and stuff- we go to the terminal and write the command
					npm i spotify-web-api-js

	and we import SpotifyWebApi from "spotify-web-api-js"

	then we create an object called spotify-- const spotify=new SpotifyWebApi();
	-Now we write spotify.setAccessToken(_token) inside the UseEffect 	

	Now to fetch items from different files..eg:- fetching songs, fetching playlists, fetching items easily and quickly,
	we use --- REACT CONTEXT API ---
							Is is similar to REDUX and FLUX

	Now we create a file called DataLayer.js
	-go to index.html and enclose <App.js/> between <DataLayer.js> and <DataLayer.js/>
